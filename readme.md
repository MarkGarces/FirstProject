# How I built the Memory Game

I manipulated the DOM with javaScript, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game

• created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed

• created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play

• added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched

• create a pop-up modal when player wins game
